## Resume Parsing System Report

### Project Overview

The Resume Parsing system aims to automate the process of extracting relevant information from candidate resumes. By leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, this application will significantly reduce manual effort for HR departments.

### Implementation

The system will employ NLP techniques to analyze resume text. Key components include:

- Optical Character Recognition (OCR): Converting PDF resumes into editable text format.
- Text Preprocessing: Cleaning and structuring extracted text for NLP analysis.
- Named Entity Recognition (NER): Identifying entities like names, skills, experiences, and education.
- Machine Learning: Categorizing resumes based on extracted information and predefined criteria.

### Scope

The system will focus on extracting core information from resumes, including personal details, work experience, education, skills, and certifications. It will categorize resumes based on predefined job roles or departments. Future enhancements may include sentiment analysis, resume scoring, and integration with applicant tracking systems.

### Tech Stack

- NLP Library: Spacy for text processing and analysis.
- Machine Learning Framework: A suitable framework like TensorFlow or PyTorch for model development.
- OCR Library: For extracting text from PDF documents.
- Backend: Python or Node.js for API development.
- Database: For storing parsed data and metadata.
